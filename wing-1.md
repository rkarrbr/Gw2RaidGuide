- Throw Grenades - the special action key, will happen at every [xx:55] and [xx:25]
> "Any Bandit Sappers that spawn on the platform will target the player furthest to the west in their range on the platform with a Sapper Bomb. This will give the player a special action key and a green circle around them."

- Turrets - kill them, they do AoE over whole platform

<ins>Special Role - Kite</ins>
Kite the meatball attack to west/southwest, blink/mobility is awesome here

<ins>special Role - Canons 1/3 and 2/4</ins>
Every 30 second a canon spawn `1/3` at `[xx:30]` and `2/4` at `[xx:00]`.
Move out if safe (flame wall timing will be learnt doing this often).

__Extra__ for comm and the wannabe canon experts
Pattern is:<br>
`S W N E` (a clock)<br>
`S N W E` (a "4")<br>

`1/3` goes: <br>
`S N S W S N S W`<br>
`2/4` goes: <br>
`W E N E W E N E`
